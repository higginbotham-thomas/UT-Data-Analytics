# UT Data Analytics Course 2
  
In this course, you are working as a Data Scientist with Blackwell Electronics, but you'll be working directly with a partner called Credit One, which is a third-party credit rating authority that provides retail customer credit approval services to Blackwell.

Credit One has tasked you with examining current customer demographics to better understand what traits might relate to whether or not a customer is likely to default on their current credit obligations. Understanding this is vital to the success of Credit One because their business model depends on customers paying their debts.

Your job as a Data Scientist will be to identify which customer attributes relate significantly to customer default rates and to build a predictive model that Credit One can use to better classify potential customers as being ‘at-risk’, compared to previously implemented models. You will use machine learning regression methods in Python for this task.
